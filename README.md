This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript. The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers, but the code attempts to pass a string as the second argument. TypeScript's type system catches this error during compilation, preventing a runtime error. The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle potential string inputs using type guards or type assertions.
